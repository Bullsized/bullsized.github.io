                        <p>Superstitions are a holdover from primitive humans finding simple reasons for things they
                            don't understand. Verifiably a complete waste of mental capacity in this day and age. I'm
                            just saying, in a deterministic event, such as hitting a baseball, there actually is a
                            strict relation between cause and effect. Now, superstition, it's bringing a... A
                            probabilistic framework and projecting meaning onto a completely random sequence. See, we
                            can deduce from that, that the lucky helmet was probably not the factor in Coma's ability to
                            get a hit because he was just able to do so without it. The question now will be if this
                            new, random helmet now becomes Coma's lucky helmet.</p>

                            <h2>A hilarious, deeply relaxed comedy about male bonding, Richard Linklater’s
                                baseball-minded latest ranks right up there with his masterpieces. Read full review</h2>

                        <p>Can there be any doubt by now that Richard Linklater is America’s most relaxed and quietly
                            ambitious filmmaker? After all but reinventing the coming-of-age movie with his
                            12-years-in-the-making Boyhood—and building an even more impressive 27-year trilogy with his
                            heartbreaking “Before” movies—the director now serves up a deceptively simple comedy.

                            Everybody Wants Some!! is about nothing more (or less) than the weekend shenanigans that
                            transpire on a Texas college campus in August 1980. The school’s rowdy baseball team
                            returns, welcoming freshman pitcher Jake (Blake Jenner, a clear-eyed find) with the kind of
                            genial hazing—“fuck-with-ery,” the newbie calls it—that brings to mind Linklater’s Dazed and
                            Confused (1993). Bongs will be lit. Pink Floyd will be discussed.</p>

                        <p>There are certainly a lot of people in <em>Everybody Wants Some!!</em>, and Linklater does a fine job
                            of keeping them all in play. The nominal protagonist is Jake Bradford (Blake Jenner), a
                            freshman pitcher who has just arrived at Southeast Texas University in September 1980 to
                            live in a run-down house with his teammates. His newfound crew of bros ranges from drawling
                            innocent Billy Autrey (Will Brittain) to mustachioed weirdo Jay Niles (Juston Street) to
                            friendly stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell) to sneering senior Glenn (Tyler Hoechlin). Chief
                            among them is the philosopher-hedonist Finnegan (Glen Powell, fantastic), who chatters on
                            endlessly — the latest addition to Linklater’s roster of lovable blowhards.</p>
